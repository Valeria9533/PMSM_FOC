# PMSM_FOC (current loop)
Field-oriented control of PMSM with 15 pole pairs, halls and absolute encoder. Max current = 20 A, max voltage = 27 V.

STM32F407 MCU, HAL library.

Freemaster software is used (but not nessesarily) for useful control of motor and see plots and transients of currents, voltages, etc.
