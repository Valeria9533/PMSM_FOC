# PMSM_FOC
Field-oriented control of PMSM with 15 pole pairs, halls and absolute encoder. Max current = 20 A, max voltage = 27 V.

For now only direct torque control is implemented. Speed loop is coming soon...

Freemaster software is used for useful control of motor and see plots of currents, voltages, etc.
